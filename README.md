In this paper, we address the challenge of constructing a proof system capable of handling multiple computations that involve diverse types of tasks, such as scalable zkRollup applications. A central dilemma in this design is the trade-off between generality and efficiency: while arithmetic circuit-based SNARKs offer fast proofs but limited flexibility, zkVMs provide general-purpose programmability at the cost of considerable overhead for circuit translation. We observe that typical workloads for such applications can be naturally divided into two parts: 
 - (1) diverse, task and data-dependent application logic
 - (2) computationally intensive cryptographic operations, e.g., hashes, that are common and repetitive. 

To optimize for both efficiency and adaptability, we propose Gryphes, a hybrid framework that composes matrix lookup, a generalization of lookup arguments, together with SNARK solutions tailored for cryptographic operations. At the heart of Gryphes is a novel and efficient linking protocol, enabling seamless, efficient composition of matrix lookup + Plonk with general commit-and-prove SNARKs. 

By integrating Gryphes with Groth16 for signatures and RSA accumulators for membership proofs, we build a zkRollup prototype that achieves efficient proving, constant-size proofs, and dynamic support for thousands of transaction types. This includes our matrix lookup implementation incorporated with Plonk, as well as practical optimizations, comprehensive benchmarks, and open-sourced code. Our results demonstrate that Gryphes strikes a very good balance between functionality and efficiency, offering highly expressive and practical zkRollup systems.
